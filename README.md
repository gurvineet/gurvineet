# CloudKitchens Kitchen Workflow Optimization

## Problem Statement
CloudKitchens operates exclusively for delivery and deals with various food items (e.g., kale salad, French fries, ice) that spoil at different rates. The challenge is to optimize the kitchen workflow to minimize food waste and maximize efficiency.

## Project Structure
