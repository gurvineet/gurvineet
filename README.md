- **Spoilage Prevention**: Real-time monitoring of food spoilage risk
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive inventory and order reports
- **Performance Metrics**: Track kitchen efficiency and optimization results

## System Architecture

The system is built with a clean, modular architecture:

# Interview Strategy Guide (4.5 Hours)

This guide provides a strategic approach for implementing this system during a 4.5-hour coding interview.

## Time Allocation Strategy

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup (30 minutes)
- **Minutes 0-15**: Read and understand requirements thoroughly
- **Minutes 15-30**: Design system architecture and create project structure

**Key Activities:**
- Identify core entities: FoodItem, Order, KitchenService, WorkflowOptimizer
- Plan data flow: Inventory → Orders → Optimization → Execution
- Sketch class relationships and interfaces
- Create folder structure and initial files

### Phase 2: Core Models (45 minutes)
- **Minutes 30-60**: Implement FoodItem and Order models
- **Minutes 60-75**: Add enums and basic functionality

**Priority Order:**
1. FoodCategory and OrderStatus enums
2. FoodItem with spoilage logic
3. OrderItem and Order classes
4. Basic validation and business rules

**What to Implement:**
- Essential attributes and methods
- Basic spoilage risk calculation
- Order status management
- Simple string representations

**What to Skip Initially:**
- Complex optimization algorithms
- Advanced reporting features
- Extensive error handling

### Phase 3: Business Logic (60 minutes)
- **Minutes 75-120**: Implement KitchenService
- **Minutes 120-135**: Add basic workflow optimization

**Core Features:**
- Inventory management (add, remove, update)
- Order creation and management
- Basic workflow prioritization
- Simple performance metrics

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Start with CRUD operations
- Add basic business rules
- Implement simple optimization logic
- Focus on working functionality over perfection

### Phase 4: Testing & Demo (45 minutes)
- **Minutes 135-180**: Write essential tests
- **Minutes 180-210**: Create demonstration scripts

**Testing Priority:**
1. Model creation and validation
2. Basic service operations
3. Core business logic
4. Integration scenarios

**Demo Requirements:**

## Final Checklist (Last 15 Minutes)

Before time runs out, ensure you have:
- [ ] All core models implemented and working
- [ ] KitchenService with basic operations
- [ ] Simple workflow optimization
- [ ] Tests that pass
- [ ] Demo script that runs
- [ ] Code is reasonably clean and readable
- [ ] You can explain how the system works

## Remember

**The goal is working, demonstrable code, not perfect code.** Focus on:
1. **Functionality** - Does it solve the problem?
2. **Clarity** - Can others understand your code?
3. **Testing** - Does it work as expected?
4. **Demonstration** - Can you show it working?

A working system with basic functionality is better than a perfect design that doesn't run. Prioritize getting something working, then improve it if time allows.
